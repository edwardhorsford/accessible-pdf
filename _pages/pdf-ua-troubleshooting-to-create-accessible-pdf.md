Meaning and purpose of this website is a reference guide to solve PDF/UA issues. The tutorials shall help everyone who is interested in creating accessible PDF.

## Supported Software

Currently the following software will be treated:

*   Adobe Acrobat
*   Adobe InDesign
*   Microsoft Word

It is possible the list is going to extend. However, the most famous and popular software have priority.

## Community project

[I][1] wish this website doesn't stay a project of my own. I would like to invite anyone, who has something to contribute, to share his knowledge to this project. The goal is to become the biggest knowledge base about this topic.

### Markdown and Github

The content is written in Markdown, [external managed in Github][2] and synchronized with this website.

Markdown is a an easy markup language which is based on plain text. Additional characters structure the document and make it possible to convert the content into HTML. Here are a couple of posts about Markdown, if you want to learn more about it:

*   [Markdown (Wikipedia)][3]
*   [Mastering Markdown (Github)][4]
*   [Markdown Syntax von John Gruber][5]

Github is platform which combines collaboration and the version control software *git*. It is one of the most popular websites to share open source software, so that everyone can contribute to it. Like our example proves, it can be used for non-software projects as well.
