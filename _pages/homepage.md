Meaning and purpose of this website is a reference guide to solve PDF/UA issues. The tutorials shall help everyone who is interested in creating accessible PDF.

## Supported Software
Currently the following software will be treated:
- Adobe Acrobat
- Adobe InDesign
- Microsoft Word

It is possible the list is going to extend. However, the most famous and popular software have priority.

## Community project
[I](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/imprint) wish this website doesn't stay a project of my own. I would like to invite anyone, who has something to contribute, to share his knowledge to this project. The goal is to become the biggest knowledge base about this topic.

### Markdown and Github
The content is written in Markdown, [external managed in Github](https://github.com/pixelstrolch/accessible-pdf) and synchronized with this website.

Markdown is a an easy markup language which is based on plain text. Additional characters structure the document and make it possible to convert the content into HTML. Here are a couple of posts about Markdown, if you want to learn more about it:

- [Markdown (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- [Mastering Markdown (Github)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Markdown Syntax von John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

Github is platform which combines collaboration and the version control software *git*. It is one of the most popular websites to share open source software, so that everyone can contribute to it. Like our example proves, it can be used for non-software projects as well.

## Multilingual
This website is written in German and English. It is not impossible more languages will follow in the future.
