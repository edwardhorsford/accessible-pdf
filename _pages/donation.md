I use a lot of my spare time to maintain this website and to write posts for it. I love doing it and want to help others to create better documents.

However, I have to pay the bills for hosting and domain. You might help me with that and [become a sponsor on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/pixelstrolch).

The available tiers are:

- ☕️ **Coffee time!** [$2 a month] \
You’ll receive a **sponsor badge** and **show your appreciation** for the work I put into documenting the production of accessible PDF documents on [accessible-pdf.info](https://accessible-pdf.info).
- 🙌 **You’re awesome!** [$4 a month] \
Same as tier above.
Additionally you **help me to pay the bills** for web hosting and the domain.
- 🚀 **You absolutely rock!** [$8 a month] \
Same as tier above.
I will send you **a sticker** with the logo of the website. **Only rockstars like you will get one.**
- 🏅 **Hello Gold sponsor!** [$16 a month] \
Same as tier above.
**Your name will to be shown on [accessible-pdf.info](https://accessible-pdf.info)**

You might want to send a one-time donation. Therefore you can use the form below.
