Meaning and purpose of this website is a reference guide to solve PDF/UA issues. The tutorials shall help everyone who is interested in creating accessible PDF.

## Supported Software

Currently the following software will be treated:

*   Adobe Acrobat
*   Adobe InDesign
*   Microsoft Word

It is possible the list is going to extend. However, the most famous and popular software have priority.

## Community project

The goal of this site is to become the biggest knowledge base about accessible PDF. This is hardly possible alone. Therefore, you are sincerely invited to contribute to this community project.

### How can you help?

All comments and suggestions for changes are highly appreciated. If a change request has to be rejected, a reason will be given.

There are several ways to support this project.

*   Add missing translations or correct incorrect translations
*   Add and correct posts 
    *   Correct or complement the issue description of a troubleshooting post
    *   Amend the version info (Which versions are affected by the problem described?)
    *   Add or correct an approach of a problem
*   Make a new post (Basics, Troubleshooting)

### Markdown and Github

The content is written in Markdown, [external managed in Github][1] and synchronized with this website.

Markdown is an easy markup language which is based on plain text. Additional characters structure the document and make it possible to convert the content into HTML. Here are a couple of posts about Markdown, if you want to learn more about it:

*   [Markdown (Wikipedia)][2]
*   [Mastering Markdown (Github)][3]
*   [Markdown Syntax von John Gruber][4]

Github is platform which combines collaboration and the version control software `git`. It is one of the most popular websites to share open source software, so that everyone can contribute to it.

Like our example proves, it can be used for non-software projects as well.

**To submit changes, you need a free Github account. For more informations, see [Contributors Guide][5].**
