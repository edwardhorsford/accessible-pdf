In addition, arrows show the detour of InDesign and Word documents via Acrobat." /></div>

## Supported Software

### Markdown and Github

The content is written in Markdown, [external managed in Github](https://github.com/pixelstrolch/accessible-pdf) and synchronized with this website.

Markdown is an easy markup language which is based on plain text. Additional characters structure the document and make it possible to convert the content into HTML. Here are a couple of posts about Markdown, if you want to learn more about it:

- [Markdown (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- [Mastering Markdown (Github)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Markdown Syntax von John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

Github is platform which combines collaboration and the version control software `git`. It is one of the most popular websites to share open source software, so that everyone can contribute to it.

Like our example proves, it can be used for non-software projects as well.
