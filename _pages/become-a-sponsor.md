I use a lot of my spare time to maintain this website and to write posts for it. 
I love doing it and want to help others to create better documents.

The recommendations of the referenced products on this site are not paid advertisement. It’s just an independent and honest recommendation.
However, I have to pay the bills for hosting and domain. 

You might help me with that and [become a sponsor on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/pixelstrolch). The available tiers are:

- ☕️ **Coffee time!** [$2 a month] 
You’ll receive a **sponsor badge** and **show your appreciation**.
- 🙌 **You’re awesome!** [$4 a month] 
Same as tier above. Additionally you **help me to pay the bills** for web hosting and the domain.
- 🚀 **You absolutely rock!** [$8 a month] 
Same as tier above. I will send you **a sticker** with the logo of the website. **Only rockstars like you will get one.**
- 🏅 **Hello Gold sponsor!** [$16 a month] 
Same as tier above. **Your name will be displayed on this website**

**[Become a sponsor now](https://github.com/sponsors/pixelstrolch).** Thank you so much 💚
