Authoring software is only partly able to assign the semantically correct tags to an exported PDF. Therefore, tags needs to be changed manually as well.

You can find out which PDF tags are available and what they are required for in “[Overview of the PDF tags][1]”.

[Adobe Acrobat][2] is required for the following steps. This is not possible with the free [Adobe Acrobat Reader][3].

## Variation 1

1.  The navigation pane Tags must be opened. If you haven't used it before, it can be displayed under “View” → “Show/Hide” → “Navigation Panes”.
2.  Click once on the tag in the tags pane to select it.
3.  Click again on the selected tag to rename it manually. Attention, the tag must be spelled correctly, see “[Overview of the PDF tags][1]”.

## Variation 2

1.  The navigation pane Tags must be opened. If you haven't used it before, it can be displayed under “View” → “Show/Hide” → “Navigation Panes”.
2.  Right-click with the mouse on the tag you want to change and select “Properties” from the menu.
3.  The desired tag can be selected in the “Tag” tab and the “Type” dropdown field.
